Mangafox Download Script
========================

About
-----
Mangafox Download Script is a manga downloader similar to my old Onemanga Download Script (although onemanga.com shut down). It works by scraping the image URL from every page in a manga chapter. It then it downloads all the images.
I created this because I prefer reading manga with the use of a viewer like Comix. I also prefer keeping manga on my hard drive in case I am not connected to the internet.

Dependencies
------------

  * Python 3.3 or better
  * BeautifulSoup (``pip install beautifulsoup4``)

Tested on Arch Linux. It should work on any Linux, OS X, or Windows machine as long as the dependencies are installed.

Notes
-----
Please do not overuse and abuse this and destroy Mangafox. If you've got some cash, why not donate some to them and help them keep alive and combat server costs? I really would not like people to destroy Mangafox because of greedy downloading. Use this wisely and don't be evil.
